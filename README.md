# Heart Disease Prediction ‚Äì Data Cleaning, Preprocessing & Model Training

This project is focused on preparing and analyzing the **Heart Disease dataset** for predictive modeling.  
I worked through **EDA, data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, and training ML models** to understand which factors are most correlated with heart disease.

## üìå Project Workflow

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Basic statistical summary of the dataset
   - Distribution plots & correlations
   - Checking missing values and anomalies

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handled categorical columns:
     - Label Encoding ‚Üí For binary categories (`Sex`, `ExerciseAngina`)
     - One-Hot Encoding ‚Üí For multi-category features
   - Converted the entire dataset into numeric format for ML models
   - Removed duplicates & unnecessary columns

3. **Visualization**
   - Heatmaps to show correlation between features
   - Countplots & histograms for categorical/numeric distribution
   - Pairplots for relationships among important variables

4. **Feature Engineering**
   - Selected important features influencing heart disease
   - Normalization & scaling where required

5. **Model Training** (Future upgrade)
   - Trained predictive models on the processed dataset
   - Compared model accuracy and performance
